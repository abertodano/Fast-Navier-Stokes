- Realized that if I want the arrays to match my physical intuition, I need to put y coord first, x second. I also need to start y at the top.
- Actually, scratch that. Just accept that any outputted arrays are flipped 90 deg.
    - Output print axes:    __________ y

                           | 
                           |
                           | 
                           x 
    - Just flip it 90 deg counterclockwise in ur brain
    - Or, use coding. np.flip(np.swapaxes([arr], 0, 1), 0) will give you the result with x and y axes in place

- Got a lot of stuff in. Getting sensible results with a fairly mickey-mouse model
- Haven't implemented viscosity yet, but trying a simple drag.
- realized I forgot the advective term, lol. That's needed for turbulence.
- Added simple vector plot
- Calculating self-advection (advection of each vel. component by itself), not yet included in integral formula, waiting for cross-advection

To do:
- Get cross-advection (advection of one vel. component by another) calculating and included in integral formula(s)
    - simple center diff? will it need a flux limiter?
